title: Year in Review - 2021
---

Around the world, 2021 was about revival. As the world started to crawl back into normal daily life, away from the 
proliferating virus which kept coming back in different variants, things slowly looked up far away from the lethargic 
progress we had in the previous year. For teambi0s, the year was also about rejuvenation. We acted proactively through 
the chain-reaction of unprecedented events that the continuing pandemic had bestowed upon us, improving the team spirit 
and culture, ending the year with prodigious achievements, insights, and progress.

The team wrapped the year up as the best CTF team in the country and 28th worldwide, according to [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org)'s official ranking charts. We were placed firmly in the top 10 for many of the best international CTFs. We were at the top of the scoreboard for YASCON CTF,  runners up for the year’s ISFCR Hackathon, 5th for TAMU CTF, 6th for b01lers CTF, 7th on ISITDTU CTF Finals, and 8th on Aero CTF.

bi0s was invited to attend and play the onsite **Volga 2021 finals**, which was an international inter-university CTF. Volga is a high-profile, international jeopardy-styled CTF conducted by a group of IT enthusiasts based in Samara, Russia. Nearly 300 teams registered for the CTF worldwide, including the most prestigious teams who have been pioneering in the field of cybersecurity and research. The finals was scheduled on September 16, where the team finished in the 16-th position on the scoreboard. Our members *Jaswanth Bommidi, Pranjal Singh* and *Sourag K* flew to Russia and participated in the contest.

For the year's DOME CTF, two members of the team: *Prajwal C P* and *Adhithya Suresh Kumar* brought the trophy home. DOME CTF was a premier CTF tournament held at the [c0c0n cybersecurity conference](https://india.c0c0n.org/2021/) with the support of Beagle Security and Kerala Police Cyberdome. They received a total of 50,000 rupees as the grand prize for the same.

Furthermore, Prabith Gupta got into IDCSS 2021- the Indian Dutch Cyber Security School. He attended a few weeks of talks from professional speakers around the globe and his team project was presented at the conference. And Adhithya Sree Mohan from the binary exploitation team was selected for the winter school for 'Security, Privacy and Trust in Cyberspace' conducted by IIT Bhilai and ACM.

We hosted **[InCTF Nationals](https://inctf.in)**, **[InCTF Junior](https://junior.inctf.in)** qualifiers, and the conference and finals to be held in January 2022, completely online, just like from the previous year.

In 2021, InCTF attained new heights with more than 10,000 registrations from all across the country. A new breed of the game named **InCTF Professional** was also realized, aimed at security professionals and members of the industry.

In the second week of August, we hosted **InCTF Internationals** - bi0s' premier hacking event targeted at hackers of all ages. As always, the challenges of the event were responsibly innovated and loaded with the latest vulnerabilities to help the players stay current and have an enjoyable time and experience. At [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org)- a popular CTF players’ community, InCTFi received a weight of 54 along with enough feedback and insights to do better next time.

![CBSE Partnership](CBSE_parternship.png)

Among the technical companies who sponsored InCTF and InCTF Junior, **CBSE** (Central Board of Secondary Education) had also supported and co-organized the CTF and the conference with bi0s. With CBSE, we are positive that we were able to inspire more students than ever before through InCTFj 2021.
As always, we pledged to create a fair, engaging experience for the participants, spectators, and first-time players, proudly honoring the legacy and lineage of InCTF and we believe that we ended up doing so. At our deepest core, we are honored to see CBSE and all our sponsors, believing in the vision and the purpose of InCTF and InCTF Junior.

Team bi0s is evolving. The club is dynamically progressing through the perils of the pandemic and the repercussions of 
being remote. Even between these sweeping, swift changes, the legacy and the lineage of teambi0s remains unchanged; the 
team’s comradery attitude to progress and to improve the team and the general notion to help, teach and espouse 
cybersecurity remains as unaffected as humankind's quest for the final frontier.

title: Year in Review - 2022
---

COVID did not defeat us. Things were picking up its pace and the world was opening up to the new world we had to face. New norms were being set in the world. Everyone saw what humanity could do when they stood together and worked to the new reality we are facing today. Team bi0s also was part of that change. Our team, consisting of more than 30 people from every corner of the country, finally met with each other after 2 years of working remotely. We had contributed and collaborated online, and won and lost several things during the journey of COVID. Now we were finally together, in the same place where our forebears had initiated from. This meant we had to start a new chapter in the club’s history with the people we know the best. Our mentor **Vipin Pavithran**, had been guiding us through our toughest situations all throughout online. But now that things started to go back to normal it was finally our chance to meet him.

The year wrapped up with us being the best team in the country and 47th worldwide according to [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org)'s leaderboards. We landed in top 10 for some of the best international CTFs – 4th in WINJA CTF, 5th in HACKIM CTF, 2nd in BSidesSF CTF, 2nd in CSAW Finals, 10th in ISITDTU. We were also invited for the finals of ISITDTU 2022 held at Da Nang, Vietnam. We also stood First in Dome CTF 2022, an onsite CTF event part of the c0c0n conference held by Kerala Police Cyberdome.

As COVID restrictions were lifted around the entire world and long awaited conferences happening throughout the country and at different corners of the world. Team bi0s participated in two of the year end conferences that were held within the country. We took the train to Goa to attend the long awaited [Nullcon Conference](https://nullcon.net/goa-2022) during the start of September. We participated in the contests, met a lot of security researchers, attended tons of talks and workshops and of course collected a lot of swags while at it. We also attended the [c0c0n 2022](https://india.c0c0n.org/2022/) conference held at Kochi, Kerala organized by the Kerala Police Cyberdome. Being from the home state being held in we couldn’t avoid the opportunity to meet hackers from various corners of the state. The conferences consisted of a contest which we won for the second consecutive year.

## Team projects

This year we wanted to invite and inspire many more students into the field of cybersecurity. Being as the bearers of the knowledge the former members from the club’s history passed onto us we wanted to spread and showcase it to the rest of students outside the club. We wanted to show the opportunities within the field of cybersecurity and the welcoming community it has. We took multiple sessions, talks and also held hands-on workshops both within and outside our home campus. We were also grateful to the other universities and schools for accommodating us during our sessions and workshops.

![Workshop](workshop.png)

Our **bi0s Hardware** team conducted a hardware workshop for the freshers of our campus in order to familiarize themselves with hardware security and instill passion for the domain while at it. Several hardware equipment like arduino, proxmark and logic analyzer were given for the students to try their hands at different vulnerabilities and concepts ranging from domains like Embedded Security, Firmware, Scada, etc. A *Hardware CTF* -- titled *Wired* -- was also conducted as part of it at the end of the session as part of the recruitment procedure within the campus, students from various departments participated in the contest. An offline bootcamp was conducted at Amrita University, Coimbatore as part of advanced training for the current members of the club.

Quoting from our [last year](https://blog.bi0s.in/2021/12/30/Misc/Year-in-Review-2021/)’s review, “The legacy and the lineage of teambi0s remains unchanged; the team’s comradery attitude to progress and to improve the team and the general notion to help, teach and espouse cybersecurity remains as unaffected as humankind’s quest for the final frontier.”
